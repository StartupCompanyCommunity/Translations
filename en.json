Developers hate that!\n\nWe better get a bigger office. Go to the <strong><i class=\"fa fa-map-o\"></i> City Map</strong> and <strong>rent a better office.</strong>",
  "investor_message_milestone_valuation": "Good choice!\n\nFor the next milestone we just want you to work on your product. Keep upgrading feature levels and run marketing campaigns. Don't be afraid to hire new employees.\n\nYou can see your current valuation under your product's Stats tab.\n\nNow go <strong>reach the targeted valuation</strong>.",
  "investor_message_milestone_more_users_2": "Another well executed milestone!\n\nAlright, we have to look into improving our marketing efforts.\n\nStart by <strong>hiring a marketer</strong>.\n\nNext up, <strong>create your first Text Ads campaign</strong>. You should take a look at the insight feature. After a campaign have reached 10% of it's audience, you'll be able to get further insight. It's worth looking into!\n\n<strong>Reach the targeted registered users.</strong>",
  "investor_message_milestone_12": "Congratulations on the astounding growth of {productName}.\n\nWe need to talk about frameworks. Right now you are using a free framework which simply won't be able to handle the feature levels that we will need in the future.\n\nTo upgrade your framework, click the <strong>Upgrade</strong> button in the top right corner of your product's <strong>Features Tab</strong>.",
  "investor_message_milestone_13": "Great choice! The new framework allows you to reach much higher feature levels.\n\nIt's time to talk about servers again. Until now we have used \"cloud servers\", which is basically just someone else's server that we rent.\n\nWe believe insourcing our servers is a good idea for {productName}.\n\nStart by going to the <strong><i class=\"fa fa-map-o\"></i> City Map</strong> and <strong>rent a building suitable for hosting servers.</strong>",
  "investor_message_milestone_14": "Welcome to your brand new hosting facility!\n\nThis is where you can buy and setup your own servers instead of renting expensive cloud servers.\n\nStart by buying and placing <strong>a rack</strong>. This is where we are going to install our servers.\n\nClick on your new rack and install <strong>1 web server, 1 database server and 1 cache server.</strong>\n\nLastly, make sure all servers are configured by simply clicking the server and then clicking the <strong>Configure</strong> button. Reach the target <strong>Produced CU</strong>.",
  "investor_message_milestone_15": "Great! Our SysAdmins are saying our new servers are running optimally.\n\nYour next milestone is a big one. Currently we're losing money every month. We want you to turn the tables and make a profit. Continue to introduce and improve features, run marketing campaigns and expand your new hosting center.\n\nIt's probably a good idea to hire more Sales Executives to ensure that there are no gaps in your ad schedule.\n\nI'll get back to you <strong>when the company earns a good sum of money.</strong>",
  "investor_message_milestone_more_users_3": "Oh my gosh, congratulations!\n\n{productName} is officially making profit!\n\nI just talked with the other investors and we all believe it's time to step up!\n\nRun marketing campaigns, upgrades features and install more servers.\n\nDon't forget to hire Managers to make your life easier.\n\n<strong>Reach the target registered users.</strong>",
  "investor_message_milestone_higher_cpm": "You're making very quick progress, well done!\n\nI just left the conference room and the board believes you can make even more money!\n\nIf you haven't already, implement a higher paying revenue feature like Banner Ads or Video Ads.\n\nRemember to keep an eye on satisfaction, we do not want it to go below 50%!\n\nNegotiate some new deals and <strong>reach the target product income.</strong>",
  "investor_message_milestone_16": "The investors are super excited! Last time I heard from them, they were flying in their private jets to Marbella to celebrate. You are officially a success now!\n\nWhen you're done celebrating you should start focusing on a new goal: <strong>acquiring a competitor</strong>. It will not only require a large sum of money, but you will also need to scale our data center to be able to handle all the new users we gain from the merge.\n\n<strong>Continue to build capital until you can afford to acquire a competitor.</strong>",
  "investor_message_milestone_17": "<strong>Message from the developer:</strong> This is the last advisor tip in this beta version. More will be added in future releases.\n\nKeep going on your own, you're doing great!\n\nJonas",
